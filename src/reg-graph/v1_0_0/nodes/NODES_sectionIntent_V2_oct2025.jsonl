This human-factors requirement reduces interpretation time and prevents inadvertent exceedances of APU parameters (e.g., speed/percent RPM, Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), oil pressure) that can cause shutdowns, damage, fires, or rotor failures. It also flags any speed ranges that must be avoided due to vibration stresses. The rule harmonizes cockpit markings/ECAM/EICAS displays with common color conventions so pilots and maintainers consistently keep the APU within certified limits during start, loading, and abnormal conditions.", "events": ["FAA AD 2018-26-02 (Honeywell 36-150 series APUs): After reports of uncontained first-stage turbine wheel fractures, the FAA mandated removal of certain turbine wheels. The severity of such failures underscores why clear redline limits for APU speed/EGT must be obvious to prevent operation that could overstress rotating parts.", "Airbus A320 program lesson (FCOM/ECAM): Airbus ECAM presents APU EGT and percent RPM using green (normal), amber/yellow (caution), and red (limit/exceedance) indications as documented in A320 FCOM/ECAM description sections. This demonstrates an OEM implementing CS-25-style color coding so crews instantly see and avoid exceedances during start and bleed-air loading.", "Boeing 737NG program lesson (FCOM/EICAS): Boeing EICAS shows APU EGT and RPM with green/amber/red limit bands and redline exceedance cues, as described in the 737NG FCOM system indications. This illustrates industry-standard adoption of color markings to keep APU operation within certified ranges, directly reflecting the rule’s purpose."]}
